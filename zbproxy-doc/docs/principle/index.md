# Principle

The principle pages are about ZBProxy itself.

We will talk about the ZBProxy structure, how it works, and how to develop around it.

ZBProxy is highly modular, so you can reference it or parts of it in other projects without modifying it, and achieve some amazing features. ZBProxy has no upper limit.

Details of the ZBProxy package can be found in the Go pkg:
