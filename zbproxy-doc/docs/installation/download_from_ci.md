# Download from CI

We use GitHub Action as our CI provider.

CI builds provide you with ZBProxy builds with unreleased and under-development features.
This is **NOT** nightly builds since we only build them when the software reaches a certain level of stability.

This will provide more convenience than [building from source](build_from_source.md) yourself.

## Download

All CI builds are available at https://github.com/layou233/ZBProxy/actions/workflows/build.yml

**Logging in to GitHub is required to download these builds.**

Choose the latest successful build, the proper platform and download.

All done. Then follow the steps in [Setup](../setup).
